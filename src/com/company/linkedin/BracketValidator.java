     * We iterate through our string, making sure that:
     *
     * each closer corresponds to the most recently seen, unclosed opener
     * every opener and closer is in a pair
     * We use a stack â†´ to keep track of the most recently seen, unclosed opener.
     * And if the stack is ever empty when we come to a closer, we know that closer doesn't have an opener.
     *
     * So as we iterate:
     *
     * If we see an opener, we push it onto the stack.
     * If we see a closer, we check to see if it is the closer for the opener at the top of the stack.
     * If it is, we pop from the stack. If it isn't, or if the stack is empty, we return false.
     * If we finish iterating and our stack is empty, we know every opener was properly closed.
